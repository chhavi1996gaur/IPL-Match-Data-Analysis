# IPL-Match-Data-Analysis
In this file I analysed the IPL matches data from 2008 to 2020. I performed EDA on the data in order to extract as much information from the data as possible and 
visualized the relationship in very attractive and colorful graphs. For the EDA I used Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly libraries and I tried to make the graph readable.
